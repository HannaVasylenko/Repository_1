Christmas Without You
OneRepublic

It's almost midnight where you lay your head
But I'm calling numbers, buying plane tickets in bed
Every channel on the TV, "It's A Wonderful Life"
I don't feel so wonderful on this cold winter night
I missed Thanksgiving, missed a birthday or two
Didn't make St. Valentines, but I was thinkin' of you
Only one thing in the world that I couldn't do
Only one thing could kill me, Christmas without you
Oh, the snow is on the ground
The day's getting colder, I'm coming home now
So go ahead light the fire, turn that Christmas tree on
'Cause I've been missing you so much I wrote you this song, yes, I did
I missed Thanksgiving, missed a birthday or two
Didn't make St. Valentines, but I was thinkin' of you
Only one thing in the world that I couldn't do
Only one thing could kill me, Christmas without you
